### System Requirements

The following system requirements must be met to install and operate ALtibase.

The requirements and recommendations listed in this chapter assume that your database will be used for general purposes. If you plan to use your database for a special purpose, contact [Altibase's Customer Support site](http://support.altibase.com/en/) for more detailed information about system requirements.

#### Memory

64-bit OS: Minimum 1GB (2GB recommended, unlimited)

#### CPU

1 CPU or more (2 or more CPUs are recommended)

#### Hard Disk

Altibase requires a disk with sufficient storage space to hold tablespaces (to store data), transaction logs, and Altibase software. Altibase software and transaction logs require at least 1GB of space, respectively.

You should have at least 12GB of free disk space to smoothly run the database.

#### Network

It is recommended to use a dedicated line when using the replication feature.

#### Check the Environment Before Installation

The Altibase Package Installer checks the environment before installing the product to see if the environment of the installed equipment meets the requirements for a successful installation. This process is performed without a graphical user interface (GUI).

During this operation, the Altibase Package Installer checks the following information about the server: 

-   The operating system name and version

-   The operating system mode (64-bit)

If you have downloaded an Altibase Package Installer that does not match your operating system, an error message is returned and the installation will be aborted. Finding problems with the system configuration in the previous step reduces the likelihood of encountering problems during installation.

#### Download the Package Installer

You can download the appropriate Package Installer for your operating system from [Altibase's Customer Support site](http://support.altibase.com/en/).

For more detailed information about supported operating system, please refer to  "[Download the Altibase Package Installer](#download-the-altibase-package-installer).

#### Set the Installation Mode

The Altibase Package Installer runs in one of the following modes:

-   Interactive Command-line Mode: if the DISPLAY environment variable has not been set.
-   Graphic User Interface (GUI) : If the DISPLAY environment variable has been set.

This manual assumes that the Altbiase Package Installer's installation mode is set to GUI.

##### Set GUI Mode

Users can run the Altibase Package Installer in GUI mode by setting the DISPLAY environment variable on the host computer as follows: 

```bash
$ setenv DISPLAY <machine name>:0.0
```

<machine_name> is the IP address or host name of the computer that is to display the Altibase Package Installer process. Use the `setenv` command for Shell or set `export DISPLAY=<machine name>:0.0` for Korn Shell.

In order to allow the Altibase Package Installer to run in GUI mode at a remote location other than the host computer, run the following command on the remote computer: 

```bash
$ xhost +
```

#### Start the Altibase Package Installer

To run the Altibase Package Installer, a user needs to download the Package Installer and then change file permissions, using chmod.

```bash
$ chmod +x altibase-server-7.3.0.0.0-LINUX-X86-64bit-release.run
```

Run the Altibase Package Installer.

```bash
$./altibase-server-7.3.0.0.0-LINUX-X86-64bit-release.run
```

The following dialog box displays the necessary system kernel parameters and how to set them.<br>System kernel parameters must be set using the root account. Some systems need to be rebooted after kernel parameters have been set.
!!! tip
    Kernel parameters should be manually set before proceeding to the next step. To set them after installation is complete, please refer to the $ALTIBASE_HOME/install/pre_install.sh file.
</div>

To ensure that Altibase runs properly, you should configure your system environment first. To do so, you must modify kernel parameter values using root privileges before installing Altibase. Kernel parameter values may be modified after installation; however, they must be set before running Altibase. The following is an example of showing the recommended values of system kernel parameters for each OS. For more detailed information on OS-specific kernel parameters, please refer to [*Installation Prerequisites*](#appendix-a-installation-prerequisites).

<div class="image_description" markdown>
![](../media/Installation/6e4149c8cebcfc9c18603070855832ef.png){width=720 align=left}

When the installation is completed, the Package Installer performs the following operations without GUI:

-   The properties set are updated in the altibase.properties files.

-   The altibase_user.env.file containing the basic environment for running the Altibase server is created in the $ALTIBASE_HOME/conf directory. The command to run this file is then added to the user account's configuration file (such as .bashrc or .bash_profile or .profile).
</div>

The following are examples of the altibase_user.env file and the .bash_profile file. 

=== "altibase_user.env"
    ```bash
    ALTIBASE_HOME=/home/hdb71_p/pkg_test/altibase-server-7.3;export ALTIBASE_HOME 
    PATH=${ALTIBASE_HOME}/bin:${PATH};export PATH 
    LD_LIBRARY_PATH=${ALTIBASE_HOME}/lib:${LD_LIBRARY_PATH};export LD_LIBRARY_PATH 
    CLASSPATH=${ALTIBASE_HOME}/lib/Altibase.jar:${CLASSPATH};export CLASSPATH 
    ```
=== ".bash_profile"
    ```bash
    . /home/hdb71_p/pkg_test/altibase-server-7.3/conf/altibase_user.env
    ```

#### Register or Update the Altibase License Key

<div class="image_description" markdown>
![](../media/Installation/d68302cf8f9ada6fd563be03e9f5ffd1.png){width=720 align=left}

The dialog box on the left is where you register your Altibase license key. You can register the license key with the Altibase Package Installer by either: 

-   Entering the license key directly

-   Selecting a file containing license key information

-   Postponing license registration: If you have no obtained the license key yet, then you can copy a new license file to the $ALTIBASE_HOME/conf directory after you have obtained one.
    ```bash
    $ cp license $ALTIBASE_HOME/conf/
    ```
    
    !!! note
          if you do not enter the license key at this step, the Package Installer does not ask whether or not to create a database at the next step.
    </div>

#### Preview the Altibase Quick Settings Guide

The "Altibase Quick Setting Guide" dialog box shows you how to start Altibase after it has been installed successfully. 

The Altibase Package Installer provides the following two shell scripts to help users configure system kernel parameters and environment variables easier.

-   $ALTIBASE_HOME/install/pre_install.sh  
    This script contains the minimum set of essential system kernel parameters, their recommended values, and explain how to set them
    
-   $ALTIBASE_HOME/install/post_install.sh  
    This script contains a SQL script for creating a new database (if step 2 was performed for Set Altibase Properties).
    
-   $ALTIBASE_HOME/packages/catproc.sql  
    This script contains a SQL script for using PSM.

If you select the checkbox in the next panel, the Altibase Package Installer will create a new database and run a script to use PSM, which will take a bit longer to install. If you do not select the checkbox, you must manually create the new database and run the PSM script after installation.

    3. Configure user environment variables (using the user account with 
        which Altibase was installed).
        Run the '/home/hdb71_p/pkg_test/altibase-server-7.3/install/post_install.sh' file 
        under the account with which Altibase was installed.
    
        This script performs necessary post-installation configuration. 
    
        1) Create the Altibase user environment file and apply it to the user profile.
             (/home/hdb71_p/pkg_test/altibase-server-7.3/conf/altibase_user.env)
        2) Create a database.
    
             If you selected 'YES' in response to the question about whether to create 
             a database after installation, at "Altibase Property setting step 1", 
             a database will be automatically created.
    
             If you selected 'NO' in response to this question,
             you need to create a database manually.
    
             shell> server create [DB Character Set] [National Character Set]
    
    4. Start up and shut down the server
        shell> server start
        shell> server stop
    
    5. Runs all scripts required for or used with PSM
    Run the '/home/hdb71_p/pkg_test/altibase-server-7.3/packages/catproc.sql' file.
    
    6. Connect to the database using iSQL
        shell> isql -s 127.0.0.1 -u SYS -p MANAGER
    ```

The following message appears while a database is being created.
